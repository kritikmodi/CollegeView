# collegeview

- The main purpose of this app is to provide real-time data about the events taking place at the college and the upcoming events.
- It also has an announcements section(where the urgent announcements can be posted) and a departments section(where information about the activities taking place in different departments can be posted). All these updates can be done using the Cloud Firestore, which is a real-time database.
- The app also has a map of the college on the homepage, which is interactive(can be moved around and zoomed in and out). We used alternate approaches whenever we were stuck at some point and completed this project successfully.
- Using this app, no student will miss out on any important event or announcement(since there are so many going on at the same time).
- Furthermore, ML can be used to make this app and the college map even much more interactive, pretty much like Google Maps.
- With some enhancements, the user can set reminders for any particular event and the app can also recommend events to them based on their choices.
- The area for expansion of this project is huge

Considering all these points, we assume that it's safe to say that this app can prove to be highly beneficial to college students and would make college life much more interesting for everyone!
